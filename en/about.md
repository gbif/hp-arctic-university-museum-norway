## Collections are central to the operations of any museum, and represent unique physical archives of objects and organisms.

The zoological collections of the Arctic University Museum of Norway comprise over 160.000 collection numbers, each of which can contain several specimens. The collection is divided into a wet and a dry magazine and houses 27 unique type specimens (holotypes) and 56 paratypes.
